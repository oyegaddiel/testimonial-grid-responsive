## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

The HTML snippet <article class="card bg-violet"> denotes an <article> element with dual class attributes: "card" and "bg-violet." This syntax is indicative of a technique in modern web development known as class composition, where multiple class names are applied to a single HTML element to combine their respective styling properties.
Below are the code snippets:

```html
<article class="card bg-violet">
```
```css
.bg-violet {
    background: hsl(263, 55%, 52%);
    color: #fff;
    background-image: url(images/bg-pattern-quotation.svg);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: top 10px right 100px;
}
```
In essence, the combination of "card" and "bg-violet" within a single class attribute (<article class="card bg-violet">) exemplifies an efficient method of achieving a specific visual presentation through the modular and extensible nature of class composition in HTML and CSS.

### Continued development

In upcoming projects, I plan to intensively focus on enhancing my proficiency in CSS animations and transitions. My objective is to gain a comprehensive understanding of their intricacies and maximize their potential application. Additionally, I aim to dedicate considerable attention to mastering media queries, refining my ability to create responsive designs. Another key area of focus will be on content stacking techniques, ensuring an adept command over organizing and presenting content in a visually cohesive manner. Lastly, delving into CSS custom properties will be a priority, aiming to leverage their capabilities for more streamlined and maintainable stylesheet management. This strategic approach underscores my commitment to continual skill development and the delivery of high-quality, responsive, and visually engaging web projects.
